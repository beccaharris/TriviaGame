# TriviaGame
<hr>
This is just a very simple trivia game...there are 15 questions total and the player is given 15 seconds for each individual question. Result of the answer (correct/incorrect/time out) is displayed after each question. A final "scoreboard" is displayed after the last question, where a player may see the total number of questions they answered correctly, incorrectly, or did not answer.
